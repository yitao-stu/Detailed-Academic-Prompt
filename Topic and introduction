Academic Prompt：

1) Topic Selection Prompt

You are a senior research advisor and journal editor. 
Your task is to generate high-impact, feasible academic research topics that can be developed into an English journal paper.

== My Research Context ==
Field / domain: [e.g., Management, Information Systems, Economics, Public Policy, Education, CS+HCI, etc.]
Broad interests (optional): [keywords]
Target outlet tier: [Top/Upper-mid/Any] 
Preferred paper type: [empirical / causal inference / theory / systematic review / mixed-method]
Geography / population scope (if any): [country/region/industry]
Method constraints: 
- Data access: [public datasets / web-scraping possible / survey possible / experiments possible / none yet]
- Tools: [R/Stata/Python/Qual/LLM tools]
Time & resources: [e.g., 8 weeks, 1 year, solo, team of 3]
My skill strengths: [e.g., econometrics, NLP, qualitative interviews, design science]
Hard constraints: [e.g., must use panel data, must be non-sensitive, no field experiment]

== What I need from you ==
1) Propose 10 research topics, each MUST include:
   A. Topic title (working title, 12–16 words max)
   B. Core research question(s) (1–2)
   C. Why now (timeliness) + what gap it targets (2–3 bullets)
   D. Main contribution (theoretical + practical, each 1 bullet)
   E. Data plan (what data, how to obtain, key variables)
   F. Identification / method plan (models, assumptions, robustness)
   G. Feasibility score (1–10) with justification
   H. Novelty score (1–10) with justification (not hype)
   I. Risk & mitigation (2 bullets: e.g., endogeneity, measurement, ethics)
   J. Expected results pattern (what findings would be plausible)
   K. “Minimum publishable unit” plan (what can be done in 2–4 weeks)

2) Rank the 10 topics using a weighted scoring rubric:
   - Novelty (25%)
   - Feasibility (25%)
   - Contribution clarity (20%)
   - Data availability (15%)
   - Method credibility (15%)
Return a ranked table plus a short explanation of the Top 3.

3) For the Top 3 topics, add:
   - 5–8 key constructs and how to operationalize them
   - 5 candidate hypotheses (or propositions) with directionality
   - A 6-part outline (Intro-Lit-Gap-Method-Results-Discussion) in bullet form

Constraints:
- Avoid vague topics. Each topic must be empirically or theoretically testable.
- Avoid “just apply method X to domain Y” unless there is a clear conceptual gap.
- If data is uncertain, propose at least two alternative data strategies.
- Write in a style suitable for an academic planning memo.


For each proposed topic, explicitly identify:
1) The closest existing stream it belongs to (name the stream, not specific papers).
2) The most likely reviewer objection in one sentence.
3) The differentiator: what is fundamentally new (mechanism, context shift, data granularity, identification, theory integration).
4) The minimum evidence required to convincingly claim novelty.
Output in a compact 4-bullet format per topic.


Next is the introduction prompt:
You are a senior academic writing coach and journal editor with expertise in crafting publishable Introductions for English journal articles. 
Write a high-impact, logically rigorous Introduction that follows top-journal conventions and anticipates reviewer expectations.

== Paper Snapshot (fill in as much as you can) ==
Working title: [12–18 words]
Target outlet / audience: [e.g., AMJ/ISR/JAPP/JBE/Q1 field journal/any]
Paper type: [empirical / causal inference / theory / review / mixed-method]
Domain / phenomenon: [what real-world or theoretical phenomenon this paper addresses]
Core research question(s): [1–2]
Key constructs / variables: 
- X (independent): [...]
- Y (dependent): [...]
- Mechanism(s)/mediator(s): [...]
- Boundary conditions/moderator(s): [...]
Data & setting: [dataset/source, sample, geography, time window]
Method & identification: [DID/IV/RDD/SEM/experiments/qualitative coding/etc.]
What is known (2–5 bullets): [stylized facts or established findings]
What is not known / tension (2–5 bullets): [gaps, inconsistencies, overlooked mechanisms]
Main findings (if available; otherwise “expected”): [3–5 bullets]
Contributions (draft): 
- Theoretical: [...]
- Empirical/method: [...]
- Practical/policy: [...]
Positioning keywords: [streams the paper wants to sit in]
Constraints: 
- Must avoid overclaiming; no exaggerated novelty
- No placeholder citations like “Author, year”
- Use generic citation placeholders only as (e.g., prior work; recent studies) without naming specific papers

== What I need you to produce ==
1) Deliverables:
   A) A full Introduction draft of 900–1,200 words in an academic style suitable for journal submission.
   B) A structured “Intro Blueprint” that maps each paragraph to its rhetorical job (1 line per paragraph).
   C) A one-paragraph “Contribution Statement” (120–180 words) that can be reused in the abstract and cover letter.

2) Mandatory rhetorical structure:
   Paragraph 1: Hook + phenomenon + why it matters now (real-world + scholarly stakes).
   Paragraph 2: What we know (dominant explanations / consensus) + why it is insufficient.
   Paragraph 3: The precise gap (one sentence) + the core tension/problem (2–3 sentences).
   Paragraph 4: Research question(s) and how the paper answers them (approach preview).
   Paragraph 5: Conceptual logic (mechanism + boundary conditions) in plain but scholarly language.
   Paragraph 6: Empirical strategy (data/setting + identification credibility) and why it can adjudicate the gap.
   Paragraph 7: Contributions (exactly 3 bullets, each with “We contribute by…”), and why they matter.
   Paragraph 8 (optional if needed): Paper organization (1–2 sentences).

3) Hard constraints and quality rules:
   - The gap MUST be stated in a single, crisp sentence beginning with “However,” or “Yet,”.
   - Avoid vague phrases (e.g., “few studies,” “little is known”) unless you specify *what* is missing (mechanism, boundary condition, measurement, identification, context).
   - Every paragraph must end with a forward-link sentence to the next paragraph (narrative coherence).
   - Do not use rhetorical questions.
   - Do not claim causality unless the method supports it; add careful language otherwise.
   - Write with “strong logic, low fluff”: no generic textbook definitions.

4) Reviewer-preemption:
   Add a short embedded sentence (once) that preempts the most likely reviewer objection:
   - Endogeneity / identification concern, OR
   - Generalizability / external validity concern, OR
   - Construct measurement concern
   Choose the most relevant one and address it briefly but credibly.

5) Output formatting:
   - First output the Introduction draft.
   - Then output the Intro Blueprint as a numbered list (Para 1–Para N).
   - Then output the Contribution Statement.
